      <h1>The Turning</h1>

      <p>
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> entered a university
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> had never heard of, one
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> had never dreamed of attending. It wasn’t
        the school’s fault; the fault,
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> believed then, was mine.
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> felt as if
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> had failed everyone—my parents, my teachers,
        and the version of myself <span class="letter-i">I</span> had tried so hard
        to become. Every morning,
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> spent nearly five hours commuting, drifting
        between stations like a ghost. Passing through the school gates,
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> felt strangely like livestock being led to
        slaughter. It wasn’t fear. It was emptiness. A quiet surrender.
      </p>

      <p>
        The school itself wasn’t bad. The professors were kind, the students
        ordinary. The darkness <span class="letter-i">I</span> carried had nothing
        to do with buildings or people. It came from inside: six years of effort
        collapsing in a single moment, six years of drawing, studying, pushing
        myself until <span class="letter-i">I</span> couldn’t breathe—all erased by
        one test. <span class="letter-i">I</span> didn’t hate the school.
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> hated myself for entering it.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> thought about repeating the exam, but
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> remembered the nights of exhaustion, the
        constant comparisons, the feeling of being measured and cut down by a
        system that didn’t care who <span class="letter-i">I</span> was.
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> knew <span class="letter-i">I</span>
        couldn’t return to that. So <span class="letter-i">I</span> decided to move
        forward instead. If <span class="letter-i">I</span> couldn’t rewrite the
        past, <span class="letter-i">I</span> would at least shape whatever future
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> had left.
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> studied hard.
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> attended every class.
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> collected good grades not because
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> loved the work, but because
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> needed to believe something in my life still
        mattered.
      </p>

      <p>
        And yet, <span class="letter-i">I</span> refuse to call that period my
        “dark age.” Even while my heart wandered, something quiet began to grow
        inside me. A small, stubborn hope. At first it was only a whisper—nothing
        clear, only a direction. The thought that maybe
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> could leave again. That maybe the world was
        larger than this small defeat. That maybe
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> could still become the person
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> had once imagined.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over time, that hope sharpened. It became a plan, then a decision. My
        sister, who had already gone ahead to New York, told me what to expect,
        how to prepare, what to fear and what to ignore. Her words felt like
        footsteps laid across an ocean, showing me where to place mine.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> worked for a year, saving what
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> could. The hours were long, and
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> often wondered if
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> was chasing a dream or running from a
        memory. Still, something in me insisted on going. As if the version of
        myself <span class="letter-i">I</span> had lost years ago was waiting
        somewhere else—somewhere past the horizon of the ordinary life
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> was living.
      </p>

      <p>
        So <span class="letter-i">I</span> left. <span class="letter-i">I</span>
        boarded a plane to New York with a suitcase full of clothes, a year’s
        worth of savings, and a hope that felt too fragile to name.
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> didn’t know whether
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> was escaping or beginning again. Maybe
        both. But for the first time in a long while,
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> felt the faint movement of life inside me,
        as if a door had opened and <span class="letter-i">I</span> was finally
        stepping through.
