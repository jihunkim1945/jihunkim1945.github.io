    <h1>The Stranger</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Life as stranger in my country</h2>
    <p id="first-sentence">"I died today. Or, maybe, yesterday; I can't be sure."</p>
    <h3>South Korea, my homeland</h3>
    <p>Korea is a nation marked by resilience. Emerging from colonization, war, and <br>
        rapid modernization, it transformed within a few generations into a global center<br>
         of technology and culture. Its strengths lie in education, industriousness, and <br>
         a deep sense of community. For many, Korea symbolizes pride, speed, and innovation.<br>
          Yet this progress carries weight: intense competition, social pressure, and limited <br>
          personal freedoms often leave individuals burdened. The psychology of life in Korea <br>
          is a mixture of pride in its achievements and exhaustion from its pace. It is a country <br>
          of remarkable energy, but also of quiet struggles beneath the surface.</p>

        <h4>Flight back to Korea</h4>
           <p>We trusted the wrong people. Betrayed, we left Canada behind after three long years.<br>
             Returning to Korea was not part of the plan—it was only to see my grandmother, who was<br> 
             gravely ill. We meant to go back to America. But a new president’s policies closed that <br>
             path, and we were stranded. My grandmother recovered. She was happy to see us. Perhaps I <br>
             should have been glad too.<br>

At first we waited, believing the visa would come. But time passed without change.<br> My mother enrolled us in
 a middle school. On the first day, every eye turned toward us. Even in<br> my own country,I felt the gaze of a 
 stranger.<br> Was I still an outsider here?<br>

Adapting was hard. The rhythm of Korean life, the weight of its expectations,<br> pressed on us. Making friends was slow.
 To them, we were curiosities—foreign<br> children in a land that should have been ours. I began to wonder if home was only <br>
 another place where one learns to endure.</p>
