  <p>
    In middle school, we were first treated like
    <span class="tt" data-kr="이목의 대상">curiosities</span>—
    <span class="tt" data-kr="이방인">strangers</span>
    on display,
    <span class="tt" data-kr="관심의 대상">objects of attention</span>
    rather than people.
    But time has a way of
    <span class="tt" data-kr="완화하다">softening</span>
    distance.
    Eventually, there were those who approached us not with curiosity but with
    <span class="tt" data-kr="진심">sincerity</span>.
    They became our friends, and for the first time in years,
    we were seen simply as ourselves.
  </p>

  <p>
    When <span class="letter-i">I</span> advanced to high school,
    <span class="letter-i">I</span> let go of the faint hope of returning to America.
    Instead,
    <span class="letter-i">I</span> tried to
    <span class="tt" data-kr="속하다, 소속감을 느끼다">belong</span>—truly belong—to the people around me.
    And in that effort, something settled inside me.
    The feeling of being a
    <span class="tt" data-kr="이방인">stranger</span>
    eased.
    <span class="letter-i">I</span> became part of them, and the world felt less sharp.
  </p>

  <p>
    But peace was brief.
    The
    <span class="tt" data-kr="압박">pressure</span>
    of Korean education grew heavier with every passing day.
    The
    <span class="tt" data-kr="무자비한">relentless</span>
    <span class="tt" data-kr="경쟁">competition</span>
    was a constant reminder that rest was a
    <span class="tt" data-kr="사치">luxury</span>
    few could afford.
    <span class="letter-i">I</span> chased a dream
    <span class="letter-i">I</span> had carried since childhood—art school.
  </p>

  <p>
    So <span class="letter-i">I</span> drew until the images blurred,
    until the smell of
    <span class="tt" data-kr="흑연">graphite</span>
    and paint clung to me like a second skin.
    <span class="letter-i">I</span> studied until
    <span class="letter-i">I</span> no longer knew whether
    <span class="letter-i">I</span> worked for desire,
    for <span class="tt" data-kr="자부심">pride</span>,
    or for the
    <span class="tt" data-kr="기대">expectations</span>
    of adults who believed effort guaranteed reward.
  </p>

  <p>
    And then came the exam.
    <span class="letter-i">I</span> failed.<br>
    Six years of effort
    <span class="tt" data-kr="붕괴되다">collapsed</span>
    in a single moment.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="letter-i">I</span> hated myself at first.
    Then <span class="letter-i">I</span> realized it was not myself
    <span class="letter-i">I</span> despised,
    but the world <span class="letter-i">I</span> had stepped into—
    the world where one
    <span class="tt" data-kr="실수">misstep</span>
    could
    <span class="tt" data-kr="지우다">erase</span>
    years of devotion,
    where a child could be
    <span class="tt" data-kr="측정되다">measured</span>
    by a single
    <span class="tt" data-kr="점수">score</span>.
  </p>

  <p>
    That is how my youth ended:
    not with
    <span class="tt" data-kr="성취">achievement</span>,
    but with the quiet understanding that
    <span class="letter-i">I</span> had
    <span class="tt" data-kr="살아남다">survived</span>
    a system that cared little for the ones who fell.
