         The Stranger
A stranger is not only someone who lives in another land, but one who drifts within his own. He walks through familiar streets yet feels the distance between himself and the world. His words sound foreign, even to his own tongue. The stranger observes life quietly, without protest, yet everything he sees seems slightly detached—as if he were watching through glass.
To be a stranger is to belong nowhere, but also to see clearly. It is the condition of one who has crossed too many borders—geographical, emotional, and moral—and no longer believes that any place can hold him completely. In that solitude, there is both sadness and freedom. The stranger endures, not by claiming a home, but by continuing to move, quietly, between worlds.
