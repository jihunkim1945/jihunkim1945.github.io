    <h3>Definition of Immigrant </h3>
    <p>Immigration is the international movement of people to a destination country of which they are not usual 
        residents or where they do not possess nationality in order to settle as permanent residents.<br> 
        Commuters, tourists, and other short-term stays in a destination country do not fall under the definition
         of immigration or migration; seasonal labour immigration is sometimes included, however.<br>

Economically, research suggests that migration can be beneficial both to the receiving and sending countries.<br>
The academic literature provides mixed findings for the relationship between immigration and crime worldwide. <br>
Research shows that country of origin matters for speed and depth of immigrant assimilation, but that there is 
considerable assimilation overall for both first- and second-generation immigrants.<br>

Discrimination based on nationality is legal in most countries. Extensive evidence of discrimination against 
foreign-born persons in criminal justice, business, the economy, housing, health care, media, and politics has been found.<br>

<h4>About me</h4>
<p>I was born on February 18, 2003, at Grace Hospital in Ilsan, Gyeonggi Province. I was a twin. I do not remember that 
    day, but I know the place and the date. When I turned five, we moved to Guri. The apartment was different, but life
     went on as usual. Not long after, when I was old enough for kindergarten, we moved again, this time to Namyangju. 
     There I finished kindergarten and entered elementary school. I stayed for about a year and a half. Then, in the 
     second semester of second grade, my family decided to leave. We left Korea and moved to the United States.</p>
