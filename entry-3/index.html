    <h3>Land of Peace: Canada</h3>
    <p>Canada, once shaped by Indigenous nations and later divided between French and British rule, 
        carries a history of struggle and compromise.<br> Out of this past, it built an image of peace 
        and multicultural harmony. For immigrants, Canada symbolizes safety, stability, and 
        dignity—a country<br>  where diversity is officially embraced. Yet peace is never simple. 
        Foreign skills are often overlooked, winters are long, and isolation lingers.<br> Canada 
        is both a land of peace and of endurance, where true belonging comes slowly, <br> through 
        patience and resilience.</p>

        <h4>Flight to Canada</h4>
           <p>We did not leave America with ceremony. We slipped away, almost unnoticed, as though 
            the years we had endured there were nothing<br> more than a fever that had finally broken. 
            The classrooms, the harsh voices, the tired evenings of lessons—these we abandoned without 
            looking back.<br> My mother called Canada peaceful. She said it would give us air to breathe. I could not imagine what peace
 looked like, only that it was not America. <br>On the plane, the sky was blank and indifferent. Beneath the 
 clouds, the country of freedom grew smaller, until it was only a memory<br> that pressed against us like a bruise.
It was not hope that carried us across the border. It was not even belief. It was simply the need <br>to leave.
 And sometimes leaving is the only freedom a family can claim.</p>
