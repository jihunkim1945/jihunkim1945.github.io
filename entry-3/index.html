      Definition of Immigrant<br>
      Immigration is the international movement of people to a destination country of which they are not usual residents or where they do not possess nationality to settle as permanent residents. Commuters, tourists, and other short-term stays in a destination country do not fall under the definition of immigration or migration; seasonal labour immigration is sometimes included, however. Economically, research suggests that migration can be beneficial both to the receiving and sending countries. The academic literature provides mixed findings for the relationship between immigration and crime worldwide. Research shows that country of origin matters for speed and depth of immigrant assimilation, but that there is considerable assimilation overall for both first- and second-generation immigrants. Discrimination based on nationality is legal in most countries. Extensive evidence of discrimination against foreign-born persons in criminal justice, business, the economy, housing, health care, media, and politics has been found.<br><br>

      I was born on February 18, 2003, at Grace Hospital in Ilsan, Gyeonggi Province. I was a twin. I do not remember that day, but I know the place and the date. When I turned five, we moved to Guri. The apartment was different, but life went on as usual. Not long after, when I was old enough for kindergarten, we moved again, this time to Namyangju. There I finished kindergarten and entered elementary school. I stayed for about a year and a half. Then, in the second semester of second grade, my family decided to leave. We left Korea and moved to the United States.<br><br>
