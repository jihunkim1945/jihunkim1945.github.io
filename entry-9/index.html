      <h1>The Departure to New York</h1>

      <p>
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> came to New York almost as if 
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> were running away. The city felt unfamiliar, even though 
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> had lived in the U.S. before. As a child, 
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> had lived in the suburbs with my mother, far from the city. Living with my sister now, in a place 
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> had only known from a distance, made New York feel entirely new. Even with two years of childhood memories, returning as an adult felt like arriving in a foreign country for the first time.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> relied heavily on my sister, and 
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> found part-time jobs to cover rent and the tuition for my portfolio program. For a full year, 
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> worked harder than 
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> ever had—driven by necessity, by hope, and by a quiet desperation. The places 
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> worked gave me experiences 
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> did not expect, both good and painful. Some memories still return as nightmares. 
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> was often scolded simply for being young, treated as if my age erased my worth. Still, through those moments, 
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> learned how society worked—its harshness, its demands, its strange sense of order.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the year passed, my portfolio neared completion. And then, a single ray of light reached us—my family received notice to attend our green card interview after nine long years of waiting. Filled with excitement, 
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> flew back to Korea immediately. For three anxious months, we lived in uncertainty, holding our breath. But in the end, our long-held hope was granted.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not long after, acceptance letters began to arrive from several universities. And among them was the one 
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> wanted most—Parsons. At that moment, the inferiority 
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> had carried for so long finally loosened its grip. For the first time in years, 
        <span class="letter-i">I</span> felt the weight lift.

      <h2>Looking back</h2>
      <p>
        I came to New York almost as if I were running away. The city felt unfamiliar, even though I had lived in the U.S. before. As a child, I had lived in the suburbs with my mother, far from the city. Living with my sister now, in a place I had only known from a distance, made New York feel entirely new.

      <p>
        I relied heavily on my sister, and I found part-time jobs to cover rent and the tuition for my portfolio program. For a full year, I worked harder than I ever had—driven by necessity, by hope, and by a quiet desperation. Those jobs showed me both the cruelty and structure of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        After nine years of waiting, my family was finally called for our green card interview. That moment turned the endless waiting into a real future. Soon after, I received several acceptance letters—among them, Parsons. For the first time in a long while, the heaviness I carried began to lift.
